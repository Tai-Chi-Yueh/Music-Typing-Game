# Music-Typing-Game
In spite of many bugs in this project, it's enough to be called a music typing game and help you dealing with your teacher. 
尽管这个项目里面有一堆bug，但这东西还是足以被称为一款音乐打字游戏并且帮你应付一下老师的。
In order to keep you from involving in unnecessary trouble, here, we have to mention about those potential error or maybe some obvious mistakes in our project.
为了避免你陷入不必要的麻烦，这里我不得不提一下这个项目里面潜在的错误和一些明显的问题。
1、Breifly speaking, the main problem is that the game can't run twice without restarting it. If you want to play it again, don't click "Play". This will make the whole game a mess. If you don't want to embarrass yourself in front of your teacher, just shutdown the project and then start it up again.
1、简单来说，主要问题就是这个游戏不能在不重启的情况下玩第二次。如果你想再玩一次，请不要点开始游戏。这样会使整个游戏崩溃。如果你还不想在老师面前出丑，就直接把程序关闭，然后再打开就可以玩了。
2、A DOS-box will show up along with Project2 (bgm player), luckily, it lies under our game interface, so just let it go.
2、随着项目2（背景音乐播放器）打开，会自动弹出DOS窗口，幸运的是，这个窗口会显示在游戏界面以下，所以就不用管他了。
3、Don't change file path, this may make our project get into trouble.
3、不要改变文件路径，这可能会使项目出错。
4、Click "WindowsProject1.sln" to start.
4、点击"WindowsProject1.sln"文件开始游戏
5、Google will help you a lot.
5、百度一下，你就知道。
